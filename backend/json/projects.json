    "background": "<p>For a while, I've been meaning to create a personal portfolio, but due to school and work taking up quite a large chunk of my time, it kept getting pushed to the back burner. But as the semester's coming to an end, I finally felt it was about time to finish this up and actually put it to good use. The site isn't just a place to showcase my work—it's also meant to demonstrate my thought process and to serve as a public record of my progress, showing how far I've come and how far I can go.</p><br><p>While I originally created it for my personal use, I've open-sourced it and designed it in a way that lets anyone (with some minor tweaks) to take the base I've built and use it for themselves—no holds barred. If you're interested, check out the README on GitHub for instructions.</p><br><p>If you find any bugs or have suggestions for updates or changes, feel free to reach out via the contact form above!</p>",
